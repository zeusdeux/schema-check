schema-check
====

Checks for schema.org schemas on a page and recursively for all the links on that page.

Demo it [here](http://colorfad.in:8008). Be gentle though, it isn't on a production ready box.

### Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zeusdeux/schema-check.git

cd schema-check

npm install

bower install

node bin/server
```

You probably want to use something like [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) or [monit](http://mmonit.com/monit/) to keep the process up though.

Have fun!
